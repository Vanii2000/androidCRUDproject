# androidCRUDproject
Android project to complete the Android course at OE-AMK. 

## Purpose of the project:
The purpose is to create an application which represents a basic inventory system to help the chosen company's processes.

## User stories:
*Create an application for a small company - deals with selling boardgames - to help to keep its inventory up-to-date.
*It has to be a function to create a new product (board game) with its attributes. 
*According to the price and quantity it should be able to calculate the total revenue by the concrete game. It has to be calculated for all the games at a total amount.
*It has to be a function to update the chosen boardgame's traits.
*It has to be a function to delete the chosen boardgame.

## The classes and activities:
I created 3 activities for this app and classes for handling the database, to implement the boardgame's model.

## Activities:
*activity_main.xml: Contains the create button (to open the activity_create_product.xml activity), a listview where the boardgames are displayed and the "Expected Revenue" amount, calculated by all games' revenue.

*activity_create_product.xml: Here the user are able to write the new boardgame's attributes. Here there is a possibility to "Save" our work and create a new object or to "Cancel" our work to go back to Main Activity without creating any object.

*activity_edit_delete_product:
